<h2>Solution Files</h2>
<p>You can find the solutions in the <a href="hw13.sql">hw13.sql</a> file.</p>

    
<p>To complete this homework assignment, you will need to use SQLite version
3.8.3 or greater. See <a href="/lab/lab12">Lab 12</a> for setup and usage instructions.</p>

<p>To check your progress, you can run <code>sqlite3</code> directly by running:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 &#x2d;&#x2d;init hw13.sql</code></pre>

<p>You should also check your work using <code>ok</code>:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>Also recall that you can perform string concatenation with the || operator:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT &quot;hello&quot; || &quot; &quot; || &quot;world&quot;
hello world</code></pre>

<h3 class="question" id="q1">Q1: A Friend in Need Requires Turkey Indeed</h3>

<p>One of your friends has made the terrible mistake of booking Thanksgiving plane
tickets late! However, upon seeing how well you did on your 61A SQL lab, your
friend asked you to help find the best plane tickets for flying home in this
darkest of hours.</p>

<p>Of course, you'd like to find the cheapest flight possible, but regardless of
the savings, you would also like to make sure you don't send your friend on too
many flight transfers.</p>

<p>Therefore, to help out your friend, find the cheapest set of flights from <strong>SFO
to PDX</strong> but <strong>do not include options with more than two flights!</strong> You should
generate a table with the following columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The set of airports that the flights pass through.</li>
  <li>Total cost of a set of flights.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to order your table from the <strong>cheapest to most expensive</strong> option.</p>

<p>All of the available flights as well as their prices can be found in the
<code>flights</code> table.</p>

<p>You should get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM schedule;
SFO, SLC, PDX|176
SFO, LAX, PDX|186
SFO, PDX|192</code></pre>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE schedule AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  WITH trips(path, ending, flights, cost) AS (
    SELECT departure || &quot;, &quot; || arrival, arrival, 1, price FROM flights
      WHERE departure = &quot;SFO&quot; UNION
    SELECT path || &quot;, &quot; || arrival, arrival, flights + 1, cost + price
      FROM trips, flights
      WHERE ending = departure AND flights &lt; 2
  )
  SELECT path, cost FROM trips WHERE ending = &quot;PDX&quot; ORDER BY cost;</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint:</strong> As with before, you may find it helpful to create a table using
recursive select. What are all the things you need to keep track of? For
example, it might be helpful to save the number of flights taken on the current
path.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> If your table is taking a long time to generate, it might be stuck in a
loop somewhere. Notice that there are some flight paths that loop, e.g SLC to
LAX to SLC again. To handle this, consider when you should stop adding rows to
your table.</p></blockquote>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q schedule</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>Roughly speaking, our goal is to construct a table of all paths from SFO to PDX.
Obviously, there's the direct route in this case, but we also want to consider
some alternatives with more than one hop.</p>

<p><strong>Main idea:</strong> We'll start with all one hop paths starting from SFO. For each
path, we'll take another step outwards, using all the possible flight data from
where we end up after the previous hop.</p>

<p>There are a few more details that are worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have to store the path so far, otherwise all our work will be for nothing.
  Remember, we're trying to figure what possible paths there are! We also store
  the airport at the end of the path to make calculating transfers easy.</li>
  <li>In a similar vein, we also cared about the total cost, so we will store that
  information as well and update whenever we transfer planes.</li>
  <li>To avoid loops, we keep track of the current length of our path. Remember that
  our friend doesn't want to transfer planes more than twice, so we can stop
  early.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, the <code>WITH</code> table we create here isn't actually all the flights from SFO
to PDX, but all the 2 hop flights from SFO. To get the flights from SFO to PDX,
we just select those with the appropriate ending location.</p>

</div>


<h2 id="sql-aggregation">SQL Aggregation</h2>


<p>Previously, we have been dealing with queries that process one row at a time.
When we join, we make pairwise combinations of all of the rows. When we use
<code>WHERE</code>, we filter out certain rows based on the condition. Alternatively,
applying an <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html">aggregate function</a>
such as <code>MAX(column)</code> combines the values in multiple rows.</p>

<p>By default, we combine the values of the <em>entire</em> table. For example, if we
wanted to count the number of flights from our <code>flights</code> table, we could use:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from FLIGHTS;
13</code></pre>

<p>What if we wanted to group together the values in similar rows and perform the
aggregation operations within those groups? We use a <code>GROUP BY</code> clause.</p>

<p>Here's another example. For each unique departure, collect all the rows having
the same departure airport into a group. Then, select the <code>price</code> column and
apply the <code>MIN</code> aggregation to recover the price of the cheapest departure from
that group. The end result is a table of departure airports and the cheapest
departing flight.</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT departure, MIN(price) FROM flights GROUP BY departure;
AUH|932
LAS|50
LAX|89
SEA|32
SFO|40
SLC|42</code></pre>

<p>Just like how we can filter out rows with <code>WHERE</code>, we can also filter out
groups with <code>HAVING</code>. <strong>Important:</strong> A <code>HAVING</code> clause should use an aggregate
function. Suppose we want to see all airports with at least two departures:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT departure FROM flights GROUP BY departure HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= 2;
LAX
SFO
SLC</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>COUNT(*)</code> aggregate just counts the number of rows in each group.
Say we want to count the number of <em>distinct</em> airports instead. Then, we could
use the following query:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT departure) FROM flights;
6</code></pre>

<p>This enumerates all the different departure airports available in our <code>flights</code>
table (in this case: SFO, LAX, AUH, SLC, SEA, and LAS).</p>


<h3 id="self-restraint">Self Restraint</h3>


<p>Tragically, many people find themselves overeating during Thanksgiving. With
your new knowledge from 61A, you resolve to use SQL and plan a healthier meal!</p>

<p>You are given a table <code>main_course</code> where each row corresponds to a possible
Thanksgiving meal with two components: the meat and the side dish (in an amazing
display of restraint, you are limiting yourself to just one side dish). You are
also given a second table <code>pies</code> containing different types of pies as well as
their caloric content. The idea is that you will pair the two items consisting
of your main course (a row of the table <code>main_course</code>) with a pie that you will
have for dessert. Use SQL's aggregation features to answer the following
questions.</p>

<h3 class="question" id="q2">Q2: Self Restraint, Part I</h3>

<p>For this first part, we want to know how many selections of meats we have for
our meal. Use a select statement to see how many different types of meats we
have in our list of main courses (we would like to point out that the 61A staff
is inclusive, and we have included tofurky as the "meat" in some meals 🙂).</p>

<p>Store this answer in a one column, one row table called <code>number_of_options</code>.</p>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE number_of_options AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT meat) FROM main_course;</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q meals-part1</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>If we had one row per type of meat, we would be done (just count the total
number of rows). Unfortunately, some meats show up more than once. The solution
is to get a distinct count.</p>

<p>An alternate solution: group by the type of meat, and count the number of
groupings.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE number_of_options AS
  WITH options(meat) AS (
    SELECT meat FROM main_course GROUP BY meat
  )
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM options;</code></pre>

</div>

<h3 class="question" id="q3">Q3: Self Restraint, Part II</h3>

<p>Use aggregation in a select statement to count the number of "full" meals (i.e
main course plus a pie) we can make with under 2500 calories total. For example,
if you have turkey and cranberries along with pumpkin pie, you will have 2000 +
500 = 2500 calories total (2000 from the main course, 500 from the pie).</p>

<p>Store this answer in a one column, one row table called <code>calories</code>.</p>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE calories AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM main_course AS m, pies AS p
    WHERE m.calories + p.calories &lt; 2500;</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q meals-part2</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>No tricky joins needed here, just consider all combinations of main courses and
pies! Finally, we only want to keep the rows where the calorie count is not too
high. Then we just count the total number of rows in the result.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="question" id="q4">Q4: Self Restraint, Part III</h3>

<p>We are mainly concerned with what meat is in our planned meal.
For every type of meat, we want to see how healthy a meal exists with this meat
(healthier means fewer calories for our purposes). Include this information for
each meat in a table <code>healthiest_meats</code>.</p>

<p>Also, if it is possible to make ANY full meal of more than 3000 calories (even
just one) using a certain type of meat, then temptation will take over. For this
reason, <strong>exclude such types of meat from your table.</strong></p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>healthiest_meats</code> table should have two columns: meat and total calories.</li>
  <li>Each row should have a meat and the number of calories of the full meal with
  the least calories (full meals include pie) involving that type of meat.
  Finally, exclude meats that are in <strong>any</strong> full meals of more than 3000
  calories.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember that a <code>HAVING</code> clause requires an aggregate function!</p></blockquote>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE healthiest_meats AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT meat, MIN(m.calories + p.calories) AS calories
    FROM main_course AS m, pies AS p
    GROUP BY meat HAVING MAX(m.calories + p.calories) &lt; 3000;</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q meals-part3</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>We do the same join from part 2, and then we consider rows grouped by the meat
in the main course.</p>

<p>If <em>any</em> of the items in that grouping are more than 3000 calories, then that
means the maximum of the items in that grouping is more than 3000 calories and
we exclude that in the <code>HAVING</code> clause.</p>

<p>Finally, we select the combination in that grouping that has the least amount of
calories.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="shopping-spree">Shopping Spree</h3>


<h3 class="question" id="q5">Q5: Price Check</h3>

<p>After you are full from your Thanksgiving dinner, you realize that you still
need to buy gifts for all your loved ones over the holidays. However, you also
want to spend as little money as possible (you're not cheap, just looking for a
great sale!).</p>

<p>Let's start off by surveying our options. Using the <code>products</code> table, write a
query that creates a table <code>average_prices</code> that lists categories and the
average price of items in the category
(using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_price">MSRP</a> as the price).</p>

<p>You should get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM average_prices;
computer|109.09
games|349.99
phone|89.99</code></pre>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE average_prices AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT category, AVG(msrp) FROM products GROUP BY category;
  &#x2d;&#x2d; alternate solution
  &#x2d;&#x2d; SELECT category, SUM(msrp)/COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category;</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q cyber-monday-part1</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>For each category, we're interested in getting the average MSRP. This happens to
translate quite nicely into a SQL query.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="question" id="q6">Q6: The Price is Right</h3>

<p>Now, you want to figure out which stores sell each item in products for the
lowest price. Write a SQL query that uses the <code>inventory</code> table to create a
table <code>lowest_prices</code> that lists items, the stores that sells that item for the
lowest price, and the price that the store sells that item for.</p>

<p>You should expect the following output:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM lowest_prices;
Hallmart|GameStation|298.98
Targive|QBox|390.98
Targive|iBook|110.99
RestBuy|kBook|94.99
Hallmart|qPhone|85.99
Hallmart|rPhone|69.99
RestBuy|uPhone|89.99
RestBuy|wBook|114.29</code></pre>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE lowest_prices AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT * FROM inventory GROUP BY item HAVING MIN(price);</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q cyber-monday-part2</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>The inventory table lists all the products on sale at each store.</p>

<p>We're only interested in comparing like products with each other, so it makes
sense to <code>GROUP BY</code> item here. In each group, we only keep the row that has the
minimum price of that group.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="question" id="q7">Q7: Bang for your Buck</h3>

<p>You want to make a shopping list by choosing the item that is the best deal
possible for every category. For example, for the "phone" category, the uPhone
is the best deal because the MSRP price of a uPhone divided by its ratings
yields the lowest cost. That means that uPhones cost the lowest money per rating
point out of all of the phones.</p>

<p>Write a query to create a table <code>shopping_list</code> that lists the items that you
want to buy from each category.</p>

<p>After you've figured out which item you want to buy for each category, add
another column that lists the store that sells that item for the lowest price.</p>

<p>You should expect the following output:</p>

<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM shopping_list;
GameStation|Hallmart
uPhone|RestBuy
wBook|RestBuy</code></pre>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE shopping_list AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT l.name, store FROM products AS p, lowest_prices AS l
    WHERE l.item = p.name
    GROUP BY category HAVING MIN(MSRP/rating);</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint</strong>: You should use the <code>lowest_prices</code> table you created in the previous
question.</p></blockquote>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q cyber-monday-part3</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>Instead of doing one big query, we could split this into two steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a temporary table first that lists out the most cost-efficient product
  for each category (this tells us <strong>what</strong> we want to buy).</li>
  <li>Then, we combine that with the <code>lowest_prices</code> table from before to figure
  out where to buy each item (this tells us <strong>where</strong> we want to buy).</li>
</ol>

<p>Splitting up the work in this way makes a complicated problem statement much
easier to manage.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE shopping_list AS
  WITH what(name) AS (
    SELECT name FROM products GROUP BY category HAVING MIN(MSRP / rating)
  )
  SELECT p.name, l.store FROM what AS p, lowest_prices AS l WHERE p.name = l.item;</code></pre>

<p>If you stare at the solutions long enough, you should be able to convince
yourself that they do the same thing.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="question" id="q8">Q8: Driving the Cyber Highways</h3>

<p>Using the Mb (megabits) column from the <code>stores</code> table, write a query to
calculate the total amount of bandwidth needed to get everything in your
shopping list.</p>

<solution>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE total_bandwidth AS
<div class="sol-highlight">  SELECT SUM(s.mbs) FROM stores AS s, shopping_list AS sl WHERE s.store = sl.store;</div></code></pre>

</solution>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint</strong>: You should use the <code>shopping_list</code> table you created in the
previous question.</p></blockquote>

<p>Use Ok to test your code:</p><pre><code class="nohighlight">python3 ok -q cyber-monday-part4</code></pre>

<div class="sol-highlight">

<p>This truthfully isn't much of an aggregation question, but it is a nice way to
combine our work from the past couple of problems.</p>

<p>For each of the things we want to purchase, we get the "Mb" cost for getting it.
The last step is summing it all together.</p>
